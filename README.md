### About StateSong Technology

StateSong is a patented technology that converts biological data into music. The idea? Capture and record a musical rendition of a targeted state, say calm or focused. Then, replay it to bring your mind and body into that state. Using StateSong as a biofeedback tool, we can entrain our minds and bodies towards deeper states of calm, focus, sleep, exercise, even happiness.
